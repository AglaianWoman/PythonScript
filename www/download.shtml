<h3>Download</h3>
There are different options for downloading.
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
	<li>The easiest is to install through Plugin Manager.</li>
	<li>There's a full download, which contains the help file, and all the libraries Python (with &quot;_FULL&quot; in the name)</li>
	<li>... and there's a minimised version, which doesn't contain the help file, and only includes the basic Python libraries.
	You should only take this one if you're concerned about space (it's an extra couple of meg)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
There's no difference between the zip and the 7zip versions, just that the 7zip versions are smaller.
