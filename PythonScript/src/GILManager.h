    This whole schenanigans seems necessary, as you don't appear to be able to call PyGILState_Ensure() from a thread that already has the GIL.
    It just locks up, and digging into the code, it's waiting on a lock that the thread already has.

    For callbacks, it's impossible to know if the callback was generated from "within" python or not.
    For instance: you have a callback on scintilla SCN_MODIFIED.  If from a script you do editor.write('...'), you've got the GIL still when the callback comes.
    When the user makes a change, it calls the callback, but this time you *don't* have the GIL, so you need to get it.  
	
	With the different threads running the different callbacks, and python code running on a thread (*generally* - see the editor.replace() suite)
    it has become impossible to manage manually (read: the Wrong Way To Do It(tm)).  These objects manage the GIL, and provide a easy, safe way to ensure 
	you have the GIL when you need it, and give it up correctly whatever happens in the mean time.
